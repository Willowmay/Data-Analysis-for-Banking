# Python programming languages for data science tasks


I examined raw data with the purpose of deriving insights and drawing conclusions.  

Together, I also manipulated large size data sets to extract meaning and generate visualizations.

To explore the Python data analysis platform, I will focus on IPython (Interactive Python) and Jupyter Notebook. 

IPython is an enhanced interactive Python terminal specifically designed for scientific computing and data analysis; 
Jupyter Notebook is a graphical interface that combines code, text, equations, and plots in a unified interactive environment.
